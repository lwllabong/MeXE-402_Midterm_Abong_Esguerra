## INTRODUCTION: 

Linear and Logistic Regression are two common techniques used to predict outcomes, but they are suited for different types of problems.

### Linear Regression 
Linear Regression is used when we want to predict a continuous value, (e.g the price of a car, temperature, or someone's age). The goal is to fit a straight line through the data, where the input factors (like mileage or engine size) help us estimate the output like the car’s price. It minimizes the difference between actual and predicted values, allowing us to use that line to make predictions for future data.

### Logistic Regression 
Logistic Regression, on the other hand, is used when we need to predict a category, like "yes or no" decisions. For example, it helps to answer questions like "Will it rain tomorrow?" or "Is this email spam?" It doesn’t provide a straight line but instead predicts the probability that something will happen, usually expressed between 0 and 1.

##### The main difference between the two is the kind of data they deal with—linear regression works for continuous outcomes, while logistic regression handles categorical outcomes. Both are key tools in making data-driven decisions, helping us spot trends and predict results based on available information.
